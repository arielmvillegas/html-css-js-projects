Your Coffee Loader Animation 🍵

🎨Project Description: Here is a beginner-friendly project to create a coffee loading animation.

💻 Technologies: HTML CSS

👩‍🍳Process: I started by creating a header class for my '.header-content', which included a brief overview of the benefits of logging into the website. Next, I placed my login form in its own div class, allowing me to customize the appearance of its input box, remember/forogt password options, and submit button.

As I shifted my focus to the aesthetics of my CSS, I incorporated a gradient animation to achieve a dynamic background gradient effect and cover. I defined classes such as '.wrapper' class to style the login form container, featuring a transparent background border and blur effect. Whereas, the '.input-boxes' serve as the container for input elements, featuring relative positioning and a specific height. Overall, the CSS enhances the login form with a interactive background cover, styled input fields, and animated elements, resulting in a modern and visually appealing user interface.

📝 Learned: 🧠 I gained valuable insights into implementing various types of '@kwyframes' while working with the 'fill' keyframe animation. I discovered how the 'background-position' property shifts across different keyframes, starting with the image at '(0px, 140px)' and transitioning to '(-1350px, -40px)' at 80%.

💡Improvement:
Use Semantic HTML - For instance, the '.cup' and '.handle' classes represent parts of an image that isn't interactive. Therefore I could've ensured that they are marked up appropriately by instead within a 'figure' or 'div' tag, rather than using potentially non-semantic placeholders.

Optimize Animation Performance - Keyframe for 'background-position' could potentially trigger layout recalculations, affecting performance. If performance issues do arise, I'd consider animating properties like 'transform' instead, which wouldn't affect layout and is more performant.
